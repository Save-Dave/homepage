            <font face = "verdana" color = "black">Our neighborhoods are important.  However, we are polluting them everyday. Littering traps, poisons, and kills animals. The six pack ring on the side of the road could choke a bird and the pieces of glass in the corner could slice the feet of a cat. We can minimize the damage by throwing away trash in the right containers. Recycling is important because it not only takes it off the street but also takes potentially reusable items out of landfills. Carpooling is another easy way to help the environment. It cuts down on the emissions, traffic, and amount of fuel needed.
I will:
be conscious of environmental issues and to do my part in preserving it
not litter
carpool as much as I can
dispose of trash in the right container
