Poaching is the illegal killing of animals, drastically shrinking the population of species. It can also refer to the illegal collection of plants, decreasing the population and variety in the species. In an effort to not lose forests, we fight to stop all forest fires. But for certain environments, it is more beneficial to let the fire run its course. Without wildfires, plants in those environments grow thick and tall, choking out smaller plants. In other areas, trees are cut down, killing entire forests, to provide lumber and land. This takes entire habitats away from thousands of species, leaving them homeless. To combat this I will:
be conscious of environmental issues and to do my part in preserving it
remain informed and to see both sides of the argument
to preserve trees and other plants
to respect all life
