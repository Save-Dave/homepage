Most corporations have inadequate waste disposal, are subjected to little to no policies for pollution control, and avoid buying better technology to save money. Smokestacks put toxins in the air, water, and land. Fracking uses large amounts of water to drill into the earth with a high-pressure jet of water, sand, and chemicals to release natural gas. It puts chemicals into soil and can cause small earthquakes. But, technology like solar panels and wind turbines help reduce the amount of emissions from non-renewable resources like coal. 
I will:
be conscious of environmental issues and to do my part in preserving it
try to use renewable resources
be conscious of the practices of the company that you buy products from
